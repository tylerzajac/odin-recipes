        <h1>Mac and Cheese</h1>
        <img src="../images/Mac-and-Cheese-Unsplash.jpg">
        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This mac and cheese recipe begins with a rich, creamy roux made from melted butter and all-purpose flour whisked together over medium heat. Once the mixture turns golden and fragrant, whole milk is gradually poured in, creating a smooth base. Shredded sharp cheddar and a touch of mozzarella are slowly stirred into the warm sauce until melted and velvety. The cheese sauce is then combined with freshly boiled elbow macaroni, ensuring each piece is thoroughly coated in cheesy goodness.</p>
        <p>For a baked version, the mixture is transferred to a greased baking dish and topped with a crunchy layer of breadcrumbs mixed with a bit of Parmesan cheese. It’s then baked in the oven until the top is golden brown and bubbly. The result is a perfectly balanced mac and cheese — creamy on the inside with a crispy, savory topping. Ideal for a comforting main course or a hearty side dish, this recipe delivers classic homemade flavor with simple ingredients.</p>
